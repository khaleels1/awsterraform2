so now I have 3 accounts to work with - Dev, NonProd, Prod(mgmt), using the the access keys for the central-admin user. 
I want to do the vpc, ec2 instance and s3 setup in all 3 but want to keep the instance type, maybe region, and Env name different. 
where do i provide account numbers so it goes into 1 account based on the env variable?

Great question — you're designing a **multi-account Terraform setup** using a **centralized `central-admin` IAM user** that assumes roles into Dev, NonProd, and Prod accounts. You want to deploy a VPC, EC2, and S3 with different parameters per environment (like region, instance type, env name), and the deployments should go into the right AWS account based on the environment.

---

### ✅ Goal

Deploy to:

* **Dev Account** → with its own region, instance type, etc.
* **NonProd Account**
* **Prod Account** (also your management account)

While **reusing the same Terraform modules**, controlled via variables.

## 🏗️ Terraform Setup Overview

We'll do this using:

* `provider` block with `assume_role`
* `env` variable to switch between accounts
* separate `*.tfvars` or backend configs per environment

---

### 1. 🔑 Define Role ARNs in `locals.tf` or `variables.tf`

```hcl
variable "environment" {
  description = "Deployment environment"
  type        = string
}

locals {
  account_map = {
    dev     = "111111111111"
    nonprod = "222222222222"
    prod    = "333333333333"
  }

  region_map = {
    dev     = "us-east-1"
    nonprod = "us-west-2"
    prod    = "us-east-2"
  }

  assume_role_arn = "arn:aws:iam::${local.account_map[var.environment]}:role/CrossAccountTerraformRole"
}
```

---

### 2. 🌍 Configure the Provider

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region  = local.region_map[var.environment]

  assume_role {
    role_arn     = local.assume_role_arn
    session_name = "TerraformSession-${var.environment}"
  }

  # Uses central-admin credentials from local profile or env vars
  shared_credentials_file = "~/.aws/credentials"
  profile                 = "central-admin"
}
```

Ensure you have your local AWS CLI profile set up:

```bash
aws configure --profile central-admin
```

Or use environment variables:

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
```

---

### 3. 📦 Organize Variables Per Environment

Use different `.tfvars` files:

#### `dev.tfvars`

```hcl
environment    = "dev"
instance_type  = "t3.micro"
env_tag        = "Development"
```

#### `nonprod.tfvars`

```hcl
environment    = "nonprod"
instance_type  = "t3.small"
env_tag        = "Staging"
```

#### `prod.tfvars`

```hcl
environment    = "prod"
instance_type  = "t3.large"
env_tag        = "Production"
```

---

### 4. 📥 Use the variables in your resources

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-12345678"
  instance_type = var.instance_type
  tags = {
    Name = "web-${var.env_tag}"
    Env  = var.env_tag
  }
}
```

---

### 5. 🚀 Run Terraform for Each Environment
You only run terraform init once per environment, and it will use that backend config:

```bash
terraform init -backend-config="env=dev"
terraform plan -var-file="dev.tfvars"
terraform apply -var-file="dev.tfvars"
```

Repeat with `nonprod.tfvars` and `prod.tfvars`.

---

## ✅ Summary: What Controls the Target Account?

* The **account number** is driven by your `account_map` local variable.
* The **role to assume** (e.g., `CrossAccountTerraformRole`) must exist in each account and be trustable by the management account.
* The `environment` variable is passed via `.tfvars` or CLI to select region, account ID, etc.
* The **provider** uses `assume_role` to get temporary access to the right AWS account.
